    """
    Perform a two-proportion Z-test to compare the proportions of two groups.

    Parameters
    ----------
    llm_group : array-like
        Array containing the count of successes (e.g., accidents) in group A.
    total_A : int
        Total number of observations in group A.
    manual_group : array-like
        Array containing the count of successes (e.g., accidents) in group B.
    total_B : int
        Total number of observations in group B.

    Returns
    -------
    stat : float
        Z-test statistic.
    p_value : float
        P-value for the test.
    conclusion : str
        Interpretation of the statistical test result.

    Notes
    -----
    The two-proportion Z-test is used to determine whether there is a significant
    difference between the proportions of two independent groups.
